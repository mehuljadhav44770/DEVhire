# DEVhire

Hiring developers today is noisy and inefficient. Companies waste time filtering unqualified profiles, while developers are overwhelmed by irrelevant messages. DevHire solves this by introducing an intent-based hiring flow where connections are unlocked only when both sides are genuinely interested—creating faster, cleaner, and more meaningful hiring outcomes.
